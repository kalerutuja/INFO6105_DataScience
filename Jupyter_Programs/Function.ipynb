    "Functions are an essential part of any programming language: you might have already encountered and used some of the many fantastic functions that are built-in in the Python language or that come with its library ecosystem. However, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that your data poses to you\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions provide a mechanism to reuse code. So, if you have a code that is repeated more than once in your program, then it is better to place that code in a function. Subsequently calls can be made to the function in order to use it. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function. They are known in most programming languages, sometimes also called *subroutines* or *procedures*. A function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task. When the task is carried out, the function can or can not return one or more values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, functions provide an abstraction, so that the users of the function do not have to concern themselves with the details of the function. For example, a user of *mean* function does not have to concern themselves with the implementation of the *mean* function.\n",

    "Functions make testing of blocks of code easy which are otherwise difficult if they are amidst a larger code block. \n",

    "- **Built-in functions**, such as **help()** to ask for help, **mean()**to get the mean value, **print()** to print an object to the terminal,… You can find an overview with more of these functions  <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html\">here</a>\n",
